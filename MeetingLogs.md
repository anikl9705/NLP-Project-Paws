#### Content
project: PAWS

The main link: https://github.com/google-research-datasets/paws

(1) Read the dataset description in the main link: PAWS-Wiki + PAWS-QQP

(2) Discuss the paper:  

PAWS: Paraphrase Adversaries from Word Scrambling (https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01130)

especially the dataset generation

(3) Take a look at the dataset:  

PAWS-QQP

(4) Go through the code:  

https://github.com/google-research-datasets/paws/blob/master/qqp_generate_data.py

(5) Decide the refular meeting time with TA

#### Questions prepared for TA

* How to fine-tune BERT? 
* How to see the changes after we feed the PAWS dataset input BERT?
*

note:
(1) use the model we have now as the baseline, take a look at the 
(2) only use huggingface as the model (chose this simple one, no need to do AllanNLP)
(3) validation part
(4) add an analysis part of the report: TA's expectation: why the model can improve, and propose what we want to do in the next phase, two tasks such as unsupervised learning (*sorry I didn't hear clearly this part, add your notes here).


how to search related papers:
use key words like semantic similarity, 
search for QQP (because QQP has the same with format with PAWS).
