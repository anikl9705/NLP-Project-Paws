# NLP-Project-Paws

Paraphrase Adversaries from Word Scrambling

group project for CSE 576 Topics/Natural Language Processing


## The Team

1.Anirudh Krishna Lakshmanan (alaksh19@asu.edu)

2.SagarÂ Seth (sseth9@asu.edu)

3.Yuanyuan Tian (ytian72@asu.edu)

4.Zhemin Zhang (zzhan215@asu.edu)

5.Xinyu Zhao (Xzhao119@asu.edu)


## Getting Started

The datasets are provided in data_qqp and data_PAWS_qqp folders. The model code is present in HuggingFace/HuggingFace.ipynb.

Note: The code has been set up to be executed in colab. The file paths will need to be changed to accomodate running it in other systems.

### Setting run parameters

- The model used can be changed by changing the following block:

```
MODEL_CLASS, TOKENIZER_CLASS, PRETRAINED = (BertForSequenceClassification, BertTokenizer, 'bert-base-cased')
```

- If PAWS dataset is to be included, change the value of `PAWS_QQP` as `True`

- The other model parameters such as learning rate can be changed by specifying them in the model details.
